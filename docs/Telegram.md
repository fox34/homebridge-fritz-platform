# Telegram - First steps

Before you can use the "Telegram Notification" functionality, you need to set up a bot. Below you can see how to do this.

## Create Bot and obtain token

- Talk to BotFather, grap your phone where telegram is installed and goto **@BotFather** in Telegram or goto: https://telegram.me/botfather
- Create a new Bot: /newbot
- Enter name of your Bot: FirstWarningBot
- Enter username for Bot: FirstWarningBot
- Then you will see a token, something like this: **110201543:AAHdqTcvCH1vGWJxfSeofSAs0K5PALDsaw** - Copy token 
- In Telegram write: **/setjoingroups**
- Select the Bot that should join the Alarm group: Click the Bot and Click Enable
- Add the Bot to the group, the same procedure as when adding a normal person to a group.
- You and the Bot should now be members of the Alarm group.

## Obtain chatID

- Now you need to get the **ChatID** for the group

- Then go to url: https://api.telegram.org/botYOURBOTTOKENTHATYOUCOPIEDABOVE/getUpdates
Replace **YOURBOTTOKENTHATYOUCOPIEDABOVE** with your bot token. Remember to write bot just before your token in the url

- Look for "chat":{"id":-yyyyyyyyy,
**-yyyyyyyyy** is the groups chatid (it should have a negative sign)


Now you have both the Bot's token and Group's chatID. Have Fun.
